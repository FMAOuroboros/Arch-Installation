**This repository is currently WIP.**

2. [Perfoming a basic Arch Linux™ installation](https://github.com/FMAOuroboros/Arch-Installation/blob/master/basic_install.md)
3. [Installing individual user-mode packages - WIP](https://github.com/FMAOuroboros/Arch-Installation/blob/master/extended_installation.md)
